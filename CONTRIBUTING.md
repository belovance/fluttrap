# Contributing to Fluttrap

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Fluttrap** 💙  
Fluttrap is built for the Flutter community, by the Flutter community-and every contribution helps make UI development faster, cleaner, and more enjoyable.

This document outlines how you can contribute effectively and respectfully, whether you’re fixing a bug, suggesting an improvement, or adding a new component.

---

## Why Contribute?

Fluttrap aims to be a **UI bootstrap for Flutter**-a collection of reusable extensions, utilities, and components that save developers time and reduce repetitive work. By contributing, you help shape a toolkit that thousands of Flutter developers can rely on in real-world projects.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in many ways, including but not limited to:
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new components or utilities
- Improving documentation
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding examples or demos
- Reviewing pull requests

Every contribution, big or small, matters.

---

## Using GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are the primary channel for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Enhancement discussions

### Please keep in mind:
- Do not use issues for personal support or debugging help.
- Keep discussions focused and constructive.
- Avoid spammy comments like “+1” or “same issue”. Use GitHub reactions instead.
- Be respectful of differing opinions and ideas.

Issues that do not follow these guidelines may be closed to keep the repository healthy and focused.

---

## Issue Ownership & Workflow

The core maintainers review and prioritize issues based on impact, scope, and alignment with Fluttrap’s vision. Issues are generally **not assigned externally**, but contributors are welcome to:
- Share implementation ideas
- Propose solutions
- Open a pull request once the approach is discussed and agreed upon

Please wait for maintainers’ feedback before starting large changes to avoid duplicated or misaligned work.

---

## Bug Reports

A good bug report helps us fix problems faster.

When reporting a bug, please include:
- A clear and descriptive title
- Flutter version and platform (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Code snippets or minimal reproducible examples (preferred)

Before opening a bug:
- Check if it has already been reported
- Test against the latest version of Fluttrap

---

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome and encouraged.

When proposing a feature:
- Explain the problem it solves
- Describe how it fits into Fluttrap’s philosophy of speed and simplicity
- Provide examples or use cases if possible

Well-thought-out requests are far more likely to be accepted and implemented.

---

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the heart of Fluttrap’s growth.

### Before submitting a PR:
- Open an issue or discussion for non-trivial changes
- Keep PRs focused on a single improvement or feature
- Follow existing code style and structure
- Add documentation or examples if applicable

### PR Best Practices:
- Write clear commit messages
- Avoid unrelated changes in the same PR
- Ensure code is formatted and analyzed (`flutter analyze`)
- Test changes locally before submitting

---

## Coding Guidelines

### Flutter & Dart
- Follow official Dart and Flutter style guidelines
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep widgets small and reusable
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Write readable, self-explanatory code

### Components & Extensions
- Components should be flexible and customizable
- Defaults should be sensible and production-ready
- APIs should feel intuitive to Flutter developers

---

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation is as important as code.

You can help by:
- Improving README or guides
- Adding usage examples
- Fixing typos or unclear explanations

Documentation should be simple, practical, and developer-focused.
