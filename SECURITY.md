# Security Policy

At **Fluttrap**, security is not an afterthought — it is a core principle.  
We are committed to maintaining a secure, transparent, and resilient UI framework for the Flutter ecosystem, backed by modern security tooling and responsible disclosure practices.

---

## Supported Versions

Fluttrap is under active development. For security reasons, **only the latest released version** is supported.

Always upgrade to the most recent version to receive security fixes and improvements.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage **responsible disclosure**.

### How to report
- Please **do not open public issues** for security vulnerabilities.
- Submit a private report using GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature  
  **or**

### What to include
- Clear description of the issue

## Disclosure & Resolution Process

Once a vulnerability is confirmed:

1. The issue is reviewed and severity is assessed
2. A fix is developed, tested, and validated
3. A patched release is published
4. A security advisory is issued when appropriate

Our goal is to resolve security issues responsibly, efficiently, and transparently.

## Scope

Fluttrap is a **UI framework** and does not directly handle:
- Authentication
- User data persistence
- Networking or API communication
- Payments or sensitive user information

However, the following are considered **in scope**:
- UI-level security risks
- Unsafe defaults or configurations
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Code patterns that may introduce security concerns

---

## Dependency Security

Fluttrap relies on trusted packages from the Flutter ecosystem. Dependencies are:
- Actively monitored
- Regularly updated
- Reviewed for known vulnerabilities

---

## Best Practices for Users

We recommend all users:
- Keep Fluttrap and Flutter SDK up to date
- Follow Flutter security guidelines
- Regularly audit project dependencies
- Avoid modifying core framework internals

---

## Our Commitment

Security is a shared responsibility.  
By combining **modern tooling**, **transparent processes**, and **community collaboration**, Fluttrap aims to set a high standard for security in open-source Flutter UI frameworks.

Thank you for helping keep Fluttrap secure.
